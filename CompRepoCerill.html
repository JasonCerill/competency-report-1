        (Auto)Biographies are tricky. Everything in life is tricky.  I think I started being more aware of that while I was in the army.  That whole experience seemed to be a lesson in learning that nothing ever goes as planned, and nothing is ever really exactly like you imagine it will be.  
       <br><br>
        My focus, at the moment, is mostly focused on sustaining and improving my relationships and athletic skills; and making money is tied <i>heavily</i> into both of those equations. It's kind of like a balancing act between those three things (relationships, sports, money), and then that balance is hugely effected by other variables like sleep and diet and meditation and a bunch of other things.
        <br><br>
        The most important relationships in my life are with my fiance, my dog, and my immediate family.  My favorite sports to play are ping pong and rock climbing.  And for money, I work at a store called Play It Again Sports, and use the benefits provided for me by the VA.
